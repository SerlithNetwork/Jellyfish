# ‚ö° Jellyfish Events
Any of the events listed here are ~~probably~~ exclusive to Jellyfish and besides actually using them,
can also be useful to detect if your plugin is running in a Jellyfish environment similar to detecting [Folia](https://docs.papermc.io/paper/dev/folia-support).
```java
private static boolean isJellyfish() {
    try {
        Class.forName("net.serlith.jellyfish.event.player.PlayerBelowWorldEvent");
        return true;
    } catch (ClassNotFoundException ignored) {
        return false;
    }
}
```

## PlayerBelowWorldEvent
This is a convenience event that will only trigger for players when they're below the world. \
You won't need to listen to EntityDamageEvent and filter for Player entity and Void damage type.

# ‚ö° Fork Events
To ensure plugin compatibility with other server software, we'll try to keep an eye if any event we want to implement
already exists in other server software, and we'll implement it here with their same namespaces.

## Purpur: PlayerAFKEvent
Class: `org.purpurmc.purpur.event.PlayerAFKEvent` \
Triggers when the player goes AFK.

# üëü Startup flags
During development, since dimension height is loaded very early in the startup chain, 
we couldn't find and appropriate way to customize it in the config files without forcing
them to load very early as well. \
For this reason, we added some flags to customize world height at startup.

* `-Doverworld.min.y`
* `-Dnether.min.y`
* `-Dend.min.y`
* `-Dcaves.min.y`

These will depend on the dimension your lobby is created ~~who builds a lobby in the nether or end?~~
and should be used responsibly. \
For example, `overworld.min.y` should always be higher than `-64` and lower than `384`, `nether.min.y` 
should always be higher than `0` and lower than `256`, etc.

```shell
# Example startup script, the flag before the -jar
java -Xms2G -Xmx2G -Doverworld.min.y=0 -jar jellyfish.jar
```
